  # Contributing Infrastructure Templates

  Thank you for your interest in contributing infrastructure templates to LinkForty! This guide will help you add support for new cloud platforms and deployment methods.
</div>

## Overview

We welcome community contributions for additional infrastructure providers. This allows LinkForty users to deploy on their preferred platforms with minimal setup.

## Official vs Community Support

### Official Support (Maintained by Core Team)
- Docker & Docker Compose (`examples/`)
- Fly.io (`infra/fly.io/`)

### Community Support (Maintained by Contributors)
- All other platforms
- We validate they work but may not provide detailed troubleshooting

## Contribution Guidelines

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues/PRs** to avoid duplicate work
2. **Open a discussion** on GitHub to gauge interest
3. **Choose a popular platform** that benefits many users
4. **Test thoroughly** before submitting

### Requested Providers

We're especially interested in templates for:
- **AWS** (ECS/Fargate, Elastic Beanstalk)
- **Google Cloud** (Cloud Run, GKE)
- **Azure** (Container Instances, App Service)
- **Railway**
- **Render**
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**
- **Kubernetes** (generic manifests)
- **Terraform** (multi-cloud IaC)

## Template Requirements

### Must-Have Components

Your infrastructure template **must** include:

1. **Configuration Files**
   - Platform-specific deployment config (e.g., `app.yaml`, `terraform.tf`)
   - Environment variable template
   - Build/deployment instructions

2. **Documentation**
   - `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Step-by-step deployment guide
   - Database setup instructions
   - Redis setup instructions (optional but recommended)
   - Cost estimates for different tiers

3. **Security Guidelines**
   - SSL/TLS configuration
   - Secret management best practices
   - Network security recommendations
   - Backup strategy

4. **Testing**
   - Proof of successful deployment
   - Screenshots or deployment logs
   - Performance benchmarks (optional)

### Directory Structure

Add your template under `infra/[provider]/`:

```
infra/
├── your-provider/
│   ├── README.md                    # Quick overview
│   ├── DEPLOYMENT.md                # Detailed deployment guide
│   ├── config.[ext]                 # Platform-specific config
│   ├── .env.production.example      # Environment variables
│   └── [additional files]           # Provider-specific resources
```

### Example Structure: AWS ECS

```
infra/
├── aws-ecs/
│   ├── README.md                    # Overview of AWS ECS deployment
│   ├── DEPLOYMENT.md                # Step-by-step guide
│   ├── task-definition.json         # ECS task definition
│   ├── service.json                 # ECS service config
│   ├── cloudformation.yaml          # Infrastructure template (optional)
│   ├── .env.production.example      # Environment variables
│   └── scripts/
│       ├── setup.sh                 # Automated setup script (optional)
│       └── deploy.sh                # Deployment script (optional)

- Configuration issues unique to the platform
- Cost optimization for that platform
- Platform CLI/API usage

### Out-of-Scope Support (User's Responsibility)

- Cloud account setup and billing
- Platform account permissions/access issues
- General cloud computing questions
- Non-Link-Forty application issues

### Core LinkForty Support (Maintainers Provide)

- Application bugs
